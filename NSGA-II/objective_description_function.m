%% function [number_of_objectives, number_of_decision_variables, min_range_of_decesion_variable, max_range_of_decesion_variable] = objective_description_function()
% This function is used to completely describe the objective functions and
% the range for the decision variable space etc. The user is prompted for
% inputing the number of objectives, numebr of decision variables, the
% maximum and minimum range for each decision variable and finally the
% function waits for the user to modify the evaluate_objective function to
% suit their need.
